## Dibakar

Welcome to the mind behind Ektubeshi! I'm Dibakar, your friendly neighborhood chaos curator and coffee enthusiast. 

I believe that the most interesting learning happens when you least expect itâ€”somewhere between your third cup of coffee and your tenth "just one more article" moment. My mission is to take you on weekly journeys through the wonderfully weird intersections of life, science, psychology, and whatever random rabbit holes I've fallen into recently.

When I'm not writing about the secret lives of rubber ducks or the psychology behind our arguments with inanimate objects, you can find me:
- Procrastinating productively (it's an art form)
- Explaining complex things in unnecessarily complicated ways
- Having philosophical debates with my coffee machine
